    """
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm primarily used for exploratory
    data analysis and for making predictive models. PCA can either be carried out by eigendecomposition
    on the covariance matrix created from the design matrix, or by directly applying Singular Value Decomposition to the
    design matrix itself. 

    The result is finding dimensions that are uncorrelated with each other that have the maximum variance. 

    Parameters:
    -> data (NumPy Matrix): NumPy matrix with features on the rows and examples on the columns. 
    -> num_principal (int): The number of dimensions that the user would like to reduce the data to 

    Returns:
    -> data_transformed (NumPy Matrix): NumPy matrix of shape (num_principal, M) where num_principal is the number of 
    features in the reduced dimensionality dataset, and M is the number of examples.
